When reviewing code, focus on:

## Excluded Content
- Don't review markdown (`**.md`) files
- Don't review the contents in hidden directories such as `.kilocode`, `.kiro`

## Security Critical Issues
- Check for hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Verify proper input validation and sanitization
- Review authentication and authorization logic

## Code Quality Essentials
- Functions should be focused and appropriately sized
- Use clear, descriptive naming conventions
- Ensure proper error handling throughout

## Review Style
- Be specific and actionable in feedback
- Explain the "why" behind recommendations
- Acknowledge good patterns when you see them
- Ask clarifying questions when code intent is unclear

Always prioritize security vulnerabilities and performance issues that could impact users.

Always suggest changes to improve readability. For example, this suggestion seeks to make the code more readable and also makes the validation logic reusable and testable.

```js
// Instead of:
if (user.email && user.email.includes('@') && user.email.length > 5) {
  submitButton.enabled = true;
} else {
  submitButton.enabled = false;
}

// Consider:
function isValidEmail(email) {
  return email && email.includes('@') && email.length > 5;
}

submitButton.enabled = isValidEmail(user.email);
```
